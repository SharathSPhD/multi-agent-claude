# MCP Multi-Agent System - Simple Architecture Guide

## What is This System?

The MCP Multi-Agent System is like having a team of AI assistants that can work together on complex projects. Think of it as a smart project management system where each AI agent has special skills, and they can collaborate to complete tasks automatically.

## The Big Picture

```
You (User) → Web Interface → Backend Brain → AI Agents → Real Work Gets Done
```

### How It Works in Simple Terms

1. **You create AI agents** - Each agent is like hiring a specialist (e.g., a programmer, researcher, tester)
2. **You create tasks** - Tell the system what work needs to be done
3. **You create workflows** - Decide how agents should work together (one after another, all at once, etc.)
4. **The system runs everything** - Agents execute tasks and report back with results

## The Three Main Parts

### 1. Frontend (Web Interface)
**What it is:** The website you interact with  
**Technology:** React (like a modern website framework)  
**What you can do:**
- Create and manage AI agents
- Create and assign tasks
- Design workflows (how agents work together)
- Monitor progress in real-time
- View results and reports

**Key Pages:**
- **Dashboard** - Overview of everything happening
- **Agents** - Manage your AI team members
- **Tasks** - Create and track work items
- **Orchestration** - Design complex workflows

### 2. Backend (The Brain)
**What it is:** The invisible system that coordinates everything  
**Technology:** FastAPI (a modern Python web framework)  
**What it does:**
- Stores all your data (agents, tasks, results)
- Manages workflow execution
- Communicates with AI agents
- Provides real-time updates
- Handles security and errors

**Key Components:**
- **Database** - Remembers everything (SQLite)
- **Execution Engine** - Runs tasks and manages agents
- **API Server** - Connects frontend to backend
- **WebSocket Manager** - Provides live updates

### 3. AI Agent Layer (The Workers)
**What it is:** Individual AI agents that do actual work  
**Technology:** Claude CLI (Anthropic's AI assistant)  
**What they do:**
- Execute specific tasks assigned to them
- Use tools and resources to complete work
- Communicate with other agents when needed
- Report progress and results back

## How Agents Work Together (Workflow Patterns)

### 1. Sequential (One After Another)
```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C
```
**Example:** Research → Write → Review
**When to use:** When each step depends on the previous one

### 2. Parallel (All at Once)
```
Agent A ↘
Agent B → Results
Agent C ↗
```
**Example:** Multiple researchers working on different topics
**When to use:** When tasks are independent and can be done simultaneously

### 3. Swarm (Collaborate)
```
All agents work together, sharing information
```
**Example:** Brainstorming session where everyone contributes
**When to use:** When you need diverse perspectives on the same problem

### 4. Evaluator-Optimizer (Quality Control)
```
Worker Agents → Evaluator → Optimizer → Final Result
```
**Example:** Code development → Testing → Improvement → Deployment
**When to use:** When quality is critical and you need review cycles

## Data Flow: How Information Moves

### Creating a New Workflow
1. **You design it** in the web interface
2. **Frontend sends** your design to the backend
3. **Backend saves** it to the database
4. **System validates** everything is correct

### Running a Workflow
1. **You click "Execute"** on a workflow
2. **Backend creates** an execution plan
3. **Execution Engine starts** the appropriate agents
4. **Agents receive** their tasks via Claude CLI
5. **Progress updates** flow back through WebSockets
6. **You see** real-time progress in the web interface
7. **Results** are saved and displayed when complete

### Real-time Updates
```
Agent Progress → Backend → WebSocket → Frontend → Your Screen
```
This happens automatically every few seconds, so you always see current status.

## Key Features Explained

### 1. Agent Management
**What it means:** Each agent is like a team member with specific skills

**Agent Properties:**
- **Name & Role** - Who they are and what they do
- **Capabilities** - What tools and skills they have
- **System Prompt** - Instructions for how they should behave
- **Tools** - External resources they can use
- **Memory** - Can remember things between tasks

**Example Agent:**
```
Name: "Sarah the Researcher"
Role: "Market Research Specialist"
Capabilities: ["web search", "data analysis", "report writing"]
Tools: ["browser", "spreadsheet", "presentation software"]
```

### 2. Task Management
**What it means:** Breaking down work into specific, actionable items

**Task Properties:**
- **Title & Description** - What needs to be done
- **Expected Output** - What the result should look like
- **Priority** - How urgent it is
- **Resources** - What the agent needs to complete it
- **Dependencies** - What must be finished first

**Example Task:**
```
Title: "Research AI market trends"
Description: "Find the latest trends in AI adoption across industries"
Expected Output: "A 5-page report with charts and recommendations"
Priority: "High"
Resources: ["internet access", "industry databases"]
```

### 3. Workflow Orchestration
**What it means:** Coordinating multiple agents and tasks to achieve a larger goal

**Workflow Components:**
- **Pattern Type** - How agents work together (sequential, parallel, etc.)
- **Agent Assignments** - Which agents participate
- **Task Dependencies** - What order things happen in
- **Success Criteria** - How to know when it's complete

### 4. Execution Engine
**What it means:** The system that actually runs everything

**How it works:**
1. **Receives** workflow execution request
2. **Plans** the execution based on dependencies
3. **Starts** agents in the correct order
4. **Monitors** progress and handles errors
5. **Provides** real-time updates
6. **Collects** and organizes results

**Safety Features:**
- **Timeouts** - Tasks don't run forever
- **Error Handling** - System recovers from problems
- **Pause/Resume** - You can control execution
- **Abort** - Stop everything if needed

### 5. Memory and Context
**What it means:** Agents can remember and learn from previous work

**Types of Memory:**
- **Task Memory** - Remember details from current task
- **Session Memory** - Remember things during a workflow
- **Project Memory** - Remember across multiple workflows
- **Agent Memory** - Personal knowledge base for each agent

- Give it one simple task
- Watch how the system works
- Gradually add complexity

### 2. Design Good Agents
- Give each agent a clear, specific role
- Write detailed system prompts
- Test agents individually before using them in workflows

### 3. Plan Your Workflows
- Break large projects into smaller tasks
- Think about dependencies between tasks
- Choose the right workflow pattern for your needs

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
- Watch executions in real-time
- Learn from results and errors
- Refine your agents and tasks based on experience

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "My workflow isn't starting"
- Check that all agents are created and available
- Verify task dependencies are correct
- Make sure no agents are already busy

### "Agents are taking too long"
- Check the estimated duration on tasks
- Look at the execution logs for clues
- Consider breaking large tasks into smaller ones

### "Results aren't what I expected"
- Review agent system prompts and capabilities
- Check if agents have the right tools and resources
- Refine task descriptions to be more specific

### "The system seems slow"
- Large workflows take time - be patient
- Check system resources (CPU, memory)
- Consider running fewer agents simultaneously
