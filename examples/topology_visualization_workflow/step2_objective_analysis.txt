WORKFLOW OBJECTIVE FOR STEP 2 - DEFINE OBJECTIVE & ANALYZE:

Create an interactive visualization of a unique mathematical concept from topology that showcases the essential topological properties while being educationally accessible to students and researchers.

DETAILED OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION:

The primary goal is to develop a comprehensive educational visualization system that:

1. MATHEMATICAL RIGOR: Select and accurately represent a fascinating topology concept (such as knot theory, manifolds, or topological invariants) with proper mathematical foundations and theoretical context.

2. VISUAL EXCELLENCE: Create stunning 3D visualizations that clearly demonstrate the essential topological properties, transformations, and relationships inherent in the chosen concept.

3. EDUCATIONAL VALUE: Develop materials that make complex topology accessible across different knowledge levels, from undergraduate students to advanced researchers.

4. INTERACTIVE EXPLORATION: Implement interactive features that allow users to manipulate parameters, explore edge cases, and gain intuitive understanding of the mathematical concepts.

5. COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION: Provide thorough documentation that explains both the mathematics and the visualization techniques, enabling others to learn from and build upon the work.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

- A fully functional Python-based visualization system
- Interactive 3D renderings of the selected topology concept
- Mathematical analysis and theoretical documentation
- Educational materials and user guides
- Reusable code components for future topology visualizations

TARGET CONCEPTS (Examples):
- Knot theory: Trefoil knots, torus knots, knot invariants
- Manifolds: Klein bottles, MÃ¶bius strips, hyperbolic surfaces
- Homotopy: Fundamental groups, covering spaces
- Topological invariants: Euler characteristic, genus
- Fiber bundles: Hopf fibrations, vector bundles

This workflow will demonstrate the power of combining mathematical expertise, visualization design, programming skills, and educational communication to create meaningful learning tools for the mathematical community.
