### Step 3: Execute Workflow
1. After creating the workflow pattern, click **"Execute Pattern"**
2. Monitor the execution progress in real-time
3. Check the **Active Executions** section for detailed logs

## üìä Expected Execution Flow

### Phase 1: InfoGatherer Research (15-20 minutes)
**Agent:** InfoGatherer  
**Task:** Gather Claude Code Information  
**Activities:**
- Conducts web searches for Claude Code information
- Gathers data from official Anthropic sources
- Creates structured markdown files:
  - `claude_code_overview.md`
  - `claude_code_installation.md` 
  - `claude_code_usage.md`
  - `claude_code_updates.md`

### Phase 2: ReportWriter Processing (10-15 minutes)
**Agent:** ReportWriter  
**Task:** Create Professional Claude Code Report  
**Activities:**
- Reads markdown files created by InfoGatherer
- Analyzes and synthesizes the research data
- Creates professional HTML report:
  - `claude_code_comprehensive_report.html`
- Includes executive summary, detailed sections, and CSS styling

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure
After successful execution, the `/mnt/e/Development/mcp_a2a/examples/reporter/` directory should contain:

```
examples/reporter/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_code_overview.md          # Research phase output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_code_installation.md      # Research phase output  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_code_usage.md             # Research phase output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_code_updates.md           # Research phase output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude_code_comprehensive_report.html  # Final report
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                        # Agent context files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Agent configuration files]
```

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Watch the **Dashboard** for execution status
- Check **Agent Observation Window** for detailed agent activities
- Monitor execution logs for progress updates

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Tasks execute in wrong order  
**Solution:** Ensure **Sequential** workflow type is selected and agents/tasks are assigned in correct order

**Issue:** Agent1 doesn't perform web search  
**Solution:** Verify InfoGatherer agent has web_search capability and proper system prompt

**Issue:** Agent2 doesn't read markdown files  
**Solution:** Ensure ReportWriter task specifies dependency on Task1 completion

**Issue:** Files not created in correct directory  
**Solution:** Verify project directory path is set correctly in workflow pattern

### Success Indicators
‚úÖ InfoGatherer creates multiple .md files with web research  
‚úÖ ReportWriter reads existing .md files  
‚úÖ Final HTML report contains comprehensive analysis  
‚úÖ Sequential execution order is maintained  
‚úÖ Both agents complete their tasks successfully  

## üéâ Expected Results
Upon successful completion, you should have:
1. **Raw Research Data:** Well-structured markdown files with current Claude Code information
2. **Professional Report:** Comprehensive HTML report with executive summary, analysis, and recommendations
3. **Demonstration:** Working sequential workflow with proper agent coordination and task dependencies

This workflow demonstrates the power of multi-agent coordination where specialized agents work in sequence to produce sophisticated deliverables.
