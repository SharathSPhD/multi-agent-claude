## Common Workflows

### 1. Codebase Understanding
- **Project overview**: Quickly understand project structure
- **File location**: Find relevant code files
- **Execution tracing**: Follow code execution paths
- **Architecture analysis**: Understand design patterns

### 2. Development Tasks
- **Bug fixing**: Efficient debugging and resolution
- **Code refactoring**: Structural improvements
- **Test management**: Generate and manage test suites
- **Documentation**: Create and maintain docs
- **Pull requests**: Automated PR creation

### 3. Advanced Usage Patterns
- **Extended thinking**: Complex problem-solving
- **Session management**: Resume previous conversations
- **Parallel development**: Multiple coding sessions
- **Data piping**: Scripting and automation
- **Output formatting**: Custom response formats

### 4. Team Collaboration
- **Reference notation**: Use "@" to reference files/directories
- **Custom commands**: Team-specific slash commands
- **Shared configurations**: Project-level settings

## Security & Privacy

### Security Principles
- **Read-only by default**: Strict permission model
- **Explicit approval**: User consent required for actions
- **Folder restrictions**: Access limited to project directory
- **Transparent permissions**: Clear user control

### Prompt Injection Protection
- **Context-aware analysis** of requests
- **Input sanitization** mechanisms
- **Command blocklist** (risky commands blocked)
- **Network approval** requirements
- **Isolated contexts** for web fetching

### Best Practices
- Review suggested commands before approval
- Avoid piping untrusted content directly
- Verify changes to critical files
- Use virtual machines for external interactions
- Report suspicious behavior through HackerOne

### Enterprise Security
- Configurable permission settings
- Enterprise managed policy support
- OpenTelemetry metrics for monitoring
- Trust verification for new codebases

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

### Overview
MCP is an open protocol enabling language models to access external tools and data sources.

### Configuration Options
- **stdio servers**: Standard input/output transport
- **SSE servers**: Server-Sent Events transport
- **HTTP servers**: HTTP-based transport

### Configuration Scopes
1. **Local scope**: Personal, project-specific servers
2. **Project scope**: Team-shared servers in `.mcp.json`
3. **User scope**: Cross-project servers for individual users

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 support for remote servers
- Interactive authentication via `/mcp` command

### Resource Integration
- Reference external resources: `@server:protocol://resource/path`
- Multiple resource references in single prompt
- Slash command integration: `/mcp__servername__promptname`

### Use Cases
- PostgreSQL database connections
- GitHub issue integration
- Documentation system access
- Custom tool integrations

## Best Practices

### Effective Communication
- Start with broad questions, then narrow focus
- Use domain-specific language
- Break complex tasks into incremental steps
- Leverage Claude's deep thinking capabilities
- Customize prompts for specific project needs

### Development Workflow
- Treat Claude Code as an AI pair programmer
- Be specific with requests and requirements
- Use session management for complex projects
- Leverage context awareness for architecture decisions
- Integrate with existing development tools

### Security Considerations
- Review all suggested commands before execution
- Maintain awareness of permission requests
- Use virtual environments for untrusted operations
- Keep Claude Code updated to latest version
- Report security concerns through proper channels
